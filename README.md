## 🎮 User Guide: How to Use Chronos

The dashboard may look empty at first. Here is how to use every feature:

### 1. Creating a Mission (Task)
Look for the **Blue "+" Button** in the bottom-right corner of the dashboard. Click it to open the "New Mission" form.

-   **Title**: The name of your task (e.g., "Morning Jog").
-   **Due Date**: For one-time tasks, select a date and time.
-   **Recurrence Rule (Advanced)**:
    -   Leave empty for a one-off task.
    -   To make it recurring, use iCal format (RRule).
    -   **Examples**:
        -   Daily: `FREQ=DAILY`
        -   Weekly on Fridays: `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=FR`
        -   Every Month: `FREQ=MONTHLY`

### 2. The Dashboard Layout
-   **North Star (Top Left)**: This is your **Top Priority**. It automatically shows the task with the earliest due date. Completing this gives you the most satisfaction!
-   **Stats (Right)**:
    -   **Flame Icon**: Your current **Streak**. Complete at least one task a day to keep it alive.
    -   **Trophy Icon**: Your **Total XP**. You gain XP for every task you complete.
-   **Quick Wins (Bottom Left)**: Shows tasks that are not recurring (one-offs), perfect for quick checking.
-   **Activity History**: A visual graph of your productivity (visual placeholder for now).

### 3. Completing Tasks
-   Click the **Circle/Check button** on any task card to complete it.
-   **North Star**: Click the big "Complete Mission" button.
-   **Effect**: The task will vanish, your XP will go up, and your streak will update (refresh to see stats update if not instant).

### 4. Recurring Task Engine
-   **How it works**: When you create a task with a "Recurrence Rule", it creates a **Template**.
-   **Automation**: A background system (Edge Function) runs daily to generate actual task instances from your templates for the next 30 days.
-   **Manual Trigger**: Since we haven't deployed the cron job yet, you might only see the *first* instance immediately. Future instances are generated by the backend.

### 5. AI Integration (Experimental)
-   The system has a stub for AI. In a full production version, you could type "Remind me to call Mom every Sunday" and it would auto-fill the form. Currently, you must fill the form manually.

## 🛠️ Developer Notes

### Backend Logic
-   **Server Actions**: Located in `src/app/actions`. Handles secure data mutations.
-   **Edge Functions**: Located in `supabase/functions`. Handles the complex recurring logic.

### Troubleshooting
-   **"No active missions"**: Use the + button to create one!
-   **Stats not updating**: Try refreshing the page. The dashboard uses server-side data fetching.
